🟩 PHASE 1 — CORE TOPICS FOR SRE/DEVOPS
Step 1: Arrays basics
Step 2: Searching (binary search use cases)
Step 3: Sorting — when & why
Step 4: Hashmaps (most used in logs, metrics)
Step 5: Strings — parsing, pattern matching
Step 6: Two pointers pattern
Step 7: Sliding window pattern
Step 8: Prefix sums (fast aggregation)
Step 9: Stacks — parsing expressions, validation
Step 10: Queues — scheduling tasks, buffering
🟩 PHASE 2 — INTERMEDIATE LOGIC
Step 11: Set operations
Step 12: BFS/DFS basics (graphs)
Step 13: Tree traversal basics
Step 14: Hashing for deduplication
Step 15: Min-heap / PriorityQueue basics
Step 16: LRU Cache logic
Step 17: Producer-consumer conceptual logic
Step 18: Dependency graph basics
Step 19: Cycles detection (important for pipelines)
Step 20: Simple regex-based parsing
🟩 PHASE 3 — PROBLEM PATTERNS EVERY SRE SHOULD KNOW
Step 21: Log aggregation problems
Step 22: Frequency counting
Step 23: Top-K elements (heap)
Step 24: String sanitization/parsing problems
Step 25: Merge intervals
Step 26: Scheduling/rotation problems
Step 27: Data stream processing basics
Step 28: Deduplication logic
Step 29: Monitoring alert threshold logic
Step 30: Map/Reduce style problems
